        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>To me, in home preschool looks like kids who learn through 
            having fun. Kids can learn and grow before they get into 
            kindergarten so they can have a greater success rate at 
            excelling more academically. I want to help kids become better 
            everyday and learn important life skills.
        </p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Parents of little kids under the age of 6.</p>

        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>After seven years of private school teaching, the next chapters setting relocated to an in home preschool.
            Mountain Top in home preschool was established in 2022, with an exciting future ahead of us all. We love
            to have kids in our home and watch them as they grow to love learning. The kids enjoy playing games and 
            getting to be outside, they are happy to use their hands when it comes to hands-on activities, but we also 
            love to watch them as they are focused on listening during reading time and during work time.
        </p>
        <p> Our curriculum includes, but is not limited to, The Good and the Beautiful, Right Start Math, Who I Really Am, 
            Joy School, and Charlotte Mason. We find the curriculum we use to help our preschoolers grow and learn to love learning.</p>
        <h3>Schedule</h3>
        <p>We live in North-west Boise near Centennial High School. We currently have a class Tuesday and Thursday
            9:15-11:45. With enough interest, we are looking to fill an afternoon class from 12:15-2:45 Tuesday and 
            Thursdays as well. Afternoon classes will only open once morning classes are full enough.
